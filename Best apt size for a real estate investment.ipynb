    "\n",
    "Throughout the history of israel very few small 1-2 rooms apartments were built, the main reasons are: \n",
    "- back in the days people used to get married and start a family in a very young age, so they moved directly from their parents home with their spouse.\n",
    "- in the last 20 years more and more people are getting divorced and therefore need smaller apartments\n",
    "- the cities have the exclusive authorty to let contractors build new appartments, and they prefer big apartments with more square foot to charge property tax on. another important point is that they do not have the authority to change the property tax rate and structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "with all of that said, there are many other parameters affecting the price change of an appartment and a major one of them is the location of the apartment, in the chart below I will look at the different changes in each apartments size group in each district of the country separately. "

    "In those charts we can see that the size of the apartment is affecting its price change in a different way in each district of the country.\n",
    "intersting points to notice: \n",
    "- 5.5-6 rooms apartments appriciated by more than 25% in haifa and the south, but much less in other areas. \n",
    "- 1-2 rooms apartments appriciated the most in all areas but the North.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In conclusion:\n",
    "1-2 rooms apartments appreciated significantly more than apartments in other sizes, all over the country. but with that said, investing in real estate is nothing like investing in an index fund, and every apartment have its unique story and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "another major factor in this choice is the tax and mortgage rules:\n",
    "- Motgage: a person without an apartment can take up to 75% of the money for the purchuse from the bank, compared to up to 50% on the second apartment, there are some ways around that of course, but I will include them in another article. \n",
    "- Tax: a person without an apartment does not have to pay the 8% purchase tax on the first 1.8M NIS of the aprtment price, and pays less than 8% on the rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "therefore in many cases the it might better to buy a bigger apartment as the first apartment.  "
